# Push React Native SDK

<p>
Push SDK provides an abstraction layer to integrate Push protocol features with your Frontend as well as Backend.
This SDK is a react-native based repo of packages that helps developers to :

- Build PUSH features into their DApps
  - Notifications
  - Chat
  - Group Chat

without having to write a lot of boilerplate code. All the heavy lifting is done by the SDK, so that you the developer can focus on building features and bootstrap a DApp with PUSH features in no time!

</p>
</div>

## How to use in your app?

#### Install the SDK

```bash
yarn add @pushprotocol/react-native-sdk
```

or

```bash
npm install @pushprotocol/react-native-sdk
```

#### Install the peer dependencies

```bash
yarn add react-native-randombytes react-native-webview react-native-webview-crypto react-native-fast-openpgp react-native-get-random-values text-encoding crypto
```

or

```bash
npm install react-native-randombytes react-native-webview react-native-webview-crypto react-native-fast-openpgp react-native-get-random-values text-encoding crypto
```

#### Nodeify the crypto packages

Add postinstall script in your `package.json` file if `node_modules` are not nodeified already

```bash
"postinstall": "node_modules/.bin/rn-nodeify --install crypto,assert,url,stream,events,http,https,os,url,net,fs --hack"
```

#### Add the WebViewCrypto component in your app root

```jsx
import WebViewCrypto from 'react-native-webview-crypto';

return (
  <>
    <WebViewCrypto />
    <App />
  </>
);
```

#### Start using the Push SDK in your app

For the complete list of features and how to use them, please refer to the [restapi documentation](https://github.com/push-protocol/push-sdk/blob/main/packages/restapi/README.md#sdk-features).

```jsx
import { PushAPI, CONSTANTS } from '@pushprotocol/react-native-sdk';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const signer = new ethers.Wallet(
  '07da77f7471e5cf046ea3793421cbce90fd42a4cfcf520046a490ca1a9b636e0'
);
const account = `eip155:${signer.address}`;

const alice = await PushAPI.initialize(signer, {
  account,
  env: CONSTANTS.ENV.DEV,
});

const spam = await alice.notification.list('SPAM', {
  limit: 10,
  page: 1,
});

```

## Other Features

All the remaining features of the `restapi` SDK are available in a similar manner to the `restapi` package. You can read more about them <a href="https://github.com/push-protocol/push-sdk/blob/main/packages/restapi/README.md">HERE</a>
